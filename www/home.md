<i> Heart Diseases</i> is an app that let you visualize [Kaggle's helth dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the loading data and charts concerning the Heart Diseases Caracteristiques  and the prediction with Logistic Regression.

It has been made with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and you may find the code on [github](https://github.com/Sihamtahi/ShinyApp/).

## Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

For a quick walkthrough on the dataset have a look a the figure below.
